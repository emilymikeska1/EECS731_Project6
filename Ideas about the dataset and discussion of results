Data preprocessesing:

I didn't do much in this area except make sure there were no missing values.

Ideas about the dataset:

I would have liked to get a support vector machine running, but I had some difficulties when trying to implement it. 

Discussion of results:

The Local Outlier Factor model worked a lot better than the Isolation Forest model that I trained. 
I think they could probably both function well if the hyperparameters of the Isolation Forest were tuned. 
In any case, it was interesting for me to experiment with n_neighbors and the threshold in the Local Outlier Factor model and observe the effects. 

In the end, my best model was the Local Outlier Factor model with n_neighbors=20 and the threshold=0.005.
